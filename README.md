I collaborated with Amr and Hossam to design a website using HTML and CSS for a charitable platform called "Nawafith."

The project aims to showcase the achievements, initiatives, and agreements undertaken by this organization.

The reason behind choosing this project was our participation in a local competition involving cities across Palestine.
